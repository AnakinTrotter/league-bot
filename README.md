# League-Bot
A League of Legends bot to level up accounts. For best results use the recommended settings but it should work with little to no changes on any Windows computer.
CHECK main.py FOR RECOMMENDED SETTINGS!

Make sure you have python downloaded too: https://www.python.org/downloads/

WARNING: I am currently working on making the bot adapt to different resolutions. For now use 1920x1080 resolution and 100% zoom. Here is how to do it on Windows:
